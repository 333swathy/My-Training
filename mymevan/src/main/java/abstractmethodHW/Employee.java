/*Letâ€™s first create the superclass Employee and define a method called calculateSalary() as an abstract method.
The Contractor class inherits all properties from its parent Employee but have to provide its own implementation of calculateSalary() method 
and multiply the value of payment per hour with given working hours. 
The FullTimeEmployee also has its own implementation of calculateSalary()method. 
In this case we just multiply by constant 8 hours.*/
